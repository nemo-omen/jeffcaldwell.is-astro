Container queries finally landed in all stable browsers in February and I haven't had any time to play with them yet. Time to do some goofing around!

For these experiments, I made two Astro components. One that will be a parent container and one that will be its child. I stuck each of the components in the same directory as this post because I don't think I'll be needing them outside of this demo.

<Figure caption="The file layout for this post">
<FileTree tree={
  [
    {
      name: '/playing-with-container-queries',
      children: [
        {name: '_ChildComponent.astro'},
        {name: '_ParentComponent.astro'},
        {name: 'index.mdx'},
      ]
    },
  ]
}/>
</Figure>


<ParentComponent>
  <ChildComponent title="Test Component" description="This is a test component we'll be using to mess around with container queries." />
  <ChildComponent title="Test Component" description="This is a test component we'll be using to mess around with container queries." />
</ParentComponent>
```html
<div>
  <h2>Test Component</h2>
  <p>
    This is a test component we'll be using 
    to mess around with container queries.
  </p>
</div>
```
