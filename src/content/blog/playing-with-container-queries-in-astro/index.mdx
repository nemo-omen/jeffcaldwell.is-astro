import FileTree from '../../../components/post-components/FileTree.svelte';
import ChildComponent from './_ChildComponent.astro';
import ParentComponent from './_ParentComponent.astro';

<FileTree />

<ParentComponent>
  <ChildComponent title="Test Component" description="This is a test component we'll be using to mess around with container queries." />
  <ChildComponent title="Test Component" description="This is a test component we'll be using to mess around with container queries." />
</ParentComponent>
```html
<div>
  <h2>Test Component</h2>
  <p>
    This is a test component we'll be using 
    to mess around with container queries.
  </p>
</div>
